# Shaepr

This project focusses on supporting a dancing choreographer in his work.
It enables the user to build sequences of shapes, which hold a position and rotation for every dancer in the team.
The sequence can be played and paused and the movement of the dancers over the floor will be displayed.

This project is frozen for the time being...
